## 🚀 How to Run Any Frontend Project

If a project contains only frontend files:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Sahilghoghari07/mern-learning.git
cd mern-learning/project-folder

```

Then open index.html in browser OR use Live Server in VS Code.
Inside any React directory:

```bash
npm install
npm start

```

This will launch the development server in your browser.
